Why we build Nourriture
===
Transparency
---
There is growing demand to access reliable information about product composition for both health and ethical reasons. There are, however, no tools available to supply this information.

Health
---
It is estimated that about 60% of people around the world could suffer from food intolerance or food related inflammation.

Ethics and Religion
---
Many others follow religious or weight based diets and people are increasingly becoming aware that the way we eat is one of the primary sources of many health problems and at the same time the primary tool for well-being.
